# Handwritten Text Recognition System
TensorFlow (TF)-based Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) system developed, trained using IAM off-line HTR dataset. The model produces the recognized text after receiving input in the form of images of single words or text lines (many words). Character error rate is 10%, and 3/4 of the words in the validation-set are correctly identified.
