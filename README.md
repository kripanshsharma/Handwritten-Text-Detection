# Handwritten Text Recognition System
TensorFlow (TF)-based Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) system developed, trained using IAM off-line HTR dataset. The model produces the recognized text after receiving input in the form of images of single words or text lines (many words). Character error rate is 10%, and 3/4 of the words in the validation-set are correctly identified.

What remains is the bare minimum to recognize text with an acceptable accuracy.

It consists of 5 CNN layers, 2 RNN (LSTM) layers and the CTC loss and decoding layer.

## Train model on IAM dataset
Follow these instructions to get the IAM dataset:

* Register for free at this [website](http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database)
* Download `words/words.tgz`
* Download `ascii/words.txt`
* Create a directory for the dataset on your disk, and create two subdirectories: `img` and `gt`
* Put `words.txt` into the `gt` directory
* Put the content (directories `a01`, `a02`, ...) of `words.tgz` into the `img` directory
* Delete files from `model` directory if you want to train from scratch
* Go to the `src` directory and execute `python main.py --mode train --data_dir path/to/IAM`
* The IAM dataset is split into 95% training data and 5% validation data  
* If the option `--line_mode` is specified, 
  the model is trained on text line images created by combining multiple word images into one  
* Training stops after a fixed number of epochs without improvement
